        "# The problem: Ambiguous words\n",
        "\n",
        "Language is often ambiguous, with the same string or series of sounds corresponding to different meanings. This **ambiguity** leads to challenges for NLP, such as distinguishing between seriousness and sarcasm (e.g., \"That was great\"), or between completely different, unrelated meanings (e.g., \"I couldn't bear to part with it\" vs. \"The bear did not want to part with it\"). Often, we are interested in identifying what meaning a word has in context. Can we properly guess what a speaker means by \"bear\", or \"great\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the major areas of natural language processing is **Word Sense Disambiguation** (WSD). Under these schemes, a string is assumed to have several possible **senses**, or distinct meanings. We will discuss in greater detail in class why the idea that words have distinct meanings is challenging, from identifying and differentiating these meanings to building models that can assign a label to a given instance of a word. \n",
        "\n",
        "## The dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment will center around annotating a dataset of sentences that are stored in a `.tsv` file. This dataset, like the others we have worked with, contains one \"document\" per line. Each document in this dataset corresponds to one line, or subtitle, from a corpus of English subtitles for movies, along with some **metadata**. This particular file is structured as a matrix where the rows are records and the columns are values for that record -- it is very similar to a dictionary structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The subtitles are presented out of context, one on each line in the `.tsv`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some example subtitles, in the first column of the dataframe (`\"subtitle\"`) will look like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "* \"Neither his post , nor adjacent .\"\n",
        "* \"Send men out to post a guard .\"\n",
        "\n",
        "In the column `'word'` you will find **ambiguous words**. We have selected a small number of ambiguous words for you that have a diverse range of meanings for each. \n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset itself comes from [Rice et al. (2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-018-1107-7), a study that looked at how common different types of ambiguous words were in a corpus of subtitles. In the third column in the tsv is the `'meaning_label'`. This is a categorical label (a string `str`) for meanings from an internet dictionary called Wordsmyth. The values are often represented as numbers (\"1\", \"2\"), but may also be represented as a dash character \"-\" to indicate something like, this meaning is \"not in the Wordsmyth list.\" The labels themselves have been defined somewhat informally by lexicographers. The label you see was the product of two separate annotators (students in the Rice et al. paper's lab) going through each of these sentences by hand and assigning labels to them with the help of the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we will be doing something similar, but less complex."
